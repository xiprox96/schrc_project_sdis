Smart Driver Identification System

Ever paid for the traffic bill that your friend has got while driving your car? Or ever wanted to
know where your car visited the week before? Of course you had some times that you wanted
your car to be safe enough that no thief could try to steal. Nowadays people have a lot of
problems like these. So we thought about a new, cheap and easy method for solving this kind
of issues.
Imagine a system that a driver’s license is a magnetic card and he shows his license to the
reader in his car every time he gets in his car. So that the system easily keeps the tracks of
people using his car, or when his car has been used, etc. imagine the car having GPS system
keeping track of the places his car has visited, or where his car is in the moment. Imagine a
car not working without a driver license shown so that thieves wouldn’t try to steal cars even
if they do they would easily be caught by the system sending their data to the government.
So this kind of traffic issues can easily be solved with a bunch of hardware control and a bit
programming. The only thing we need to do is to work more on this project. Improve it and
start using this kind of technologies in our lives.
